# 🎄🎅 Simple Roblox Username Checker
The fastest Roblox username checker on GitHub.
# Quickstart
You must already have Python 3+ installed, and other than that you shouldn't have to install any other 3rd party libraries, it's simple and ready right out of the box.
# Goals
5 ⭐ = Menu & proxy support (adding tn EST 10 PM)\
10 ⭐ = Code structure rework and a over all cleaning of the code.\
15 ⭐ = Final update, unless to keep the code working: adding features like generators and enough functionality to make it a paid product.
